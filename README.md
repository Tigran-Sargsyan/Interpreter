# Interpreter
A simple programming language with python interpreter

The project was done as a homework, during which I had to create a very simple programming language with its unique syntax and build a python interpreter
which would execute the code written in that language.

The language gives the possibilities to.

> Declare variables and store values in them.

> Do simple logical comparisons.

> Do simple arithmetical calculations.

> Make comments.

> Print the results of the program.

> Check for conditions (if,else).

> Use loops for executing a block of code multiple times.

For the further use of the language check the documentation in documentation.md.
